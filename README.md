# Canberra Modern Theme - Tailwind CSS version

The basic bones of this theme have been created by Ben Ennis Butler as a starting point for students studying front-end web design (11056).

This version has been set up to use TailwindCSS.

## Built upon
There are quite a few things in use in order to get this to work:

### TailwindCSS v3.4.1
Tailwind is a utility-first CSS framework
[Tailwind Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/)

### Timber Starter Theme
The "_s" for Timber: a dead-simple theme that you can build from. The primary purpose of this theme is to provide a file structure rather than a framework for markup or styles. [Starter Theme](https://travis-ci.com/github/timber/starter-theme)

### Twig
Timber uses Twig. Twig is a flexible and secure template engine for PHP used primarily in web development to separate the logic of the application from its presentation layer.
